# FixFinder

## Project Description

FixFinder is a fully web-based platform that connects end users with local service providers across a range of services, including electricians, handymen, and other skilled professionals. The application supports two distinct user roles:

- **End Users**: End users can search for nearby service providers based on their specific requirements and location. They can view detailed provider profiles, specify required service hours, book services, and efficiently manage their bookings through a personalized dashboard.

- **Service Providers**: Service providers can manage their offerings, set pricing, and utilize a dashboard to gain insights into their revenue and performance.

FixFinder aims to streamline service discovery and booking through a user-friendly interface. End users can effortlessly search for nearby service providers based on their specific requirements, view detailed provider profiles, specify service hours, and manage bookings through a personalized dashboard. Service providers, on the other hand, can efficiently manage their offerings, set competitive pricing, and leverage a dedicated dashboard to monitor their performance, bookings, and revenue insights. FixFinder bridges the gap between users and providers, ensuring a seamless experience for both parties.
